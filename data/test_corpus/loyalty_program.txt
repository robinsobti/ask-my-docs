Loyalty Program Tiers

Every purchase earns 5 points per dollar. Shoppers reach Silver status at 2,500 points, which unlocks free standard shipping. Gold status begins at 5,000 points and adds quarterly gear drops plus a birthday reward. Platinum status at 10,000 points offers 20% off one order per season and access to invite-only events. Points expire after 24 months of inactivity, so make at least one purchase or redeem reward credits to keep your balance active.
