Digital Gift Cards

E-gift cards are sent within 10 minutes of purchase and arrive from gifts@example.com. Physical cards ship via Priority service and include tracking updates. Balances never expire, and cards can be redeemed alongside promotional discounts but not other gift cards. To check a balance, visit example.com/gift-cards and enter the 16-digit code printed on the email or card back. Lost digital cards can be resent by contacting support with the original order number.
