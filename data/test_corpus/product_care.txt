Product Care Guidelines

To keep your gear performing at its best, wipe fabrics with a damp cloth after every workout and allow them to air-dry completely before storage. Avoid fabric softeners, as they break down moisture-wicking yarns. Technical shells should be washed separately in cold water and line-dried away from direct heat to preserve the DWR coating. For footwear, remove insoles weekly and let them breathe overnight. Replace laces and insoles every six months to maintain proper support. If odor buildup occurs, sprinkle baking soda inside the item and leave it for 24 hours before brushing out gently.
