International Returns Instructions

For customers outside the United States, returns are accepted within 60 days of delivery. We do not provide prepaid labels internationally; customers may ship using any tracked courier. Duties and taxes collected at the border are non-refundable through us and should be claimed with your local customs office. Once the package is received, allow 7â€“10 business days for inspection and refund processing. Include the customs declaration form with your parcel to prevent delays.
