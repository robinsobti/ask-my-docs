Warranty Policy

Our warranty covers defects in materials and workmanship for one year from the date of purchase. To start a warranty claim, provide proof of purchase and photos of the issue to support@example.com.

Once we receive your documentation, our warranty team typically responds within 2 business days. If the issue is approved, we will ship a replacement part or issue a repair authorization. In cases where repair is not feasible, a replacement product of equal value will be offered.

The warranty does not cover normal wear and tear, accidental damage, or unauthorized modifications. Using third-party accessories that alter the product from its intended use may void coverage. For extended protection, consider adding the optional two-year care plan at checkout.
