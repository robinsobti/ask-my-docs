Shipping Policy

We offer standard (5–7 business days) and express (2–3 business days) shipping options. Tracking numbers are emailed once an order ships. Free shipping applies to domestic orders over $75.

Orders placed before 2 p.m. ET ship the same business day. All orders placed after 2 p.m. ship the following business day. During peak holidays, fulfillment may take an extra 24 hours, and we will notify you by email if delays extend beyond that.

We ship via USPS, UPS, and FedEx. The exact carrier is selected based on service availability and package weight. Unfortunately, we cannot deliver to P.O. boxes with express service; please provide a street address to avoid delays.
