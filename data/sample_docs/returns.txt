Returns & Refunds

You may return items within 30 days for a full refund. Items must be unused and in their original packaging. Refunds are issued to the original payment method within 5 business days after inspection.

Exchanges are available for the same product in an alternate size or color. To request an exchange, contact support before sending the item back so we can reserve replacement inventory. We will ship the replacement once the original item arrives at our fulfillment center.

Clearance merchandise, gift cards, and personalized items are final sale and ineligible for return. If an item arrives damaged or defective, please include photos of the packaging and the product so we can file a carrier claim on your behalf.
