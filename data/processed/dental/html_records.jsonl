Clean between teeth regularly, aiming for once a day. Use dental floss or a special brush or wooden or plastic pick recommended by a dental professional. Or try a floss holder, floss threader, or water flosser. Visit the dentist for routine check-ups and professional cleaning. If you are at a high risk for tooth decay (for example, if you have a dry mouth because of medicines you take), your dentist or dental hygienist may give you a fluoride treatment, such as a varnish or foam during the office visit. Or, the dentist may recommend a fluoride gel or mouth rinse for home use. If you are at higher risk for gum disease because of a medical condition (for example, diabetes), your dentist may want to see you more frequently. Drink fluoridated water. Drinking water with the right amount of fluoride protects your teeth throughout the day. Learn the fluoride content of your community’s water here or check with your water utility company. Don’t smoke. Smoking increases your chance of gum disease. If you smoke and want to quit, there are many resources to help you: FDA’s Center for Tobacco Products , CDC’s Quit Smoking website , and the BeTobaccoFree.gov website . If you are planning to become pregnant, have a dental checkup. Because of hormonal changes, pregnant women may develop gingivitis and experience gums that are swollen and bleed easily. During pregnancy, it is especially important to practice good oral hygiene to maintain the health of your gums. Eat a well-balanced diet. Limit sweets and sugary drinks, such as soda.\n\nBack to top", "html_fragment": "<p>Follow these tips to keep your teeth and gums healthy:</p><ul><li>Brush your teeth twice a day with a fluoride toothpaste.</li><li>Clean between teeth regularly, aiming for once a day.
